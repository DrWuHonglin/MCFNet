# MCFNet
The code of the MCFNet: Multiscale Cross-Modal Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation.

- MCFNet: A multiscale cross-modal fusion network using dual ResNet34 encoders and a lightweight MLP decoder for efficient semantic segmentation.
- MCFNet-v1  : An enhanced version of MCFNet where the 7×7 convolution in ResNet34 is replaced with three 3×3 convolutions to better capture fine-grained features.
